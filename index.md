My name is Tianyi Liu, currently a fifth year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health and a Triple Tar Heel candidate. My research is related to cell-type deconvolution and precision medicine. I also like to work with a diverse set of collaborators and use my expertise in statistical modeling and machine learning to solve prblems in public health and big data. You can find my publications and projects on this website.

In my spare time, I like to read, hike, travel, go to gym, play soccer or basketball, try new board games, and play hold'em poker. My favorite sport is soccer. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and my cat [Wrigley](members/wrigley.html).
