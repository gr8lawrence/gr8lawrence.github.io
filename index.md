I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health and about to be a Triple Tar Heel. My research lies in the fields of [cell type deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_deconvolution) and [precision medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine). I also work with a diverse set of collaborators, using my statistical modeling and machine learning knowledge to solve practical problems in public health and allied health sciences. You can find my publications and projects on this website.

In my spare time, I like to read, travel, eat well, and play sports and trivia games. I recently developed a passion in Hold'em pokers. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and my cat [Wrigley](members/wrigley.html).
