<!-- I am currently a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in [Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health and about to be a Triple Tar Heel. My research lies in the fields of [cell type deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_deconvolution) and [precision medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine). I also work with a diverse set of collaborators, using my statistical modeling and machine learning knowledge to solve practical problems in public health and allied health sciences. You can find my publications and projects on this website.

In my spare time, I like to read, travel, eat well, and play sports and trivia games. I recently developed a passion in Hold'em pokers. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and my cat [Wrigley](members/wrigley.html). -->


Hi! Nice to meet you. I am a clinical biostatistician/data scientist. I obtained a Ph.D. in [Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in August 2024. My research focused on [cell type deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_deconvolution) but also branched out into [precision medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine). During my Ph.D. program, I collaborated with a diverse group of experts to tackle real-world problems in public health and allied health sciences. I currently work for a pharmaceutical company near Philadelphia. Feel free to check out my publications and projects on this website.

In my spare time, I love to read good books, travel to new places, savor delicious meals, stay active with sports, and join trivia games. I also maintain a keen interest in playing Texas Hold'em and other poker variations. Of course, nothing beats spending quality time with my friends and hanging with my cat [Wrigley](members/wrigley.html).

Besides this website, I also maintain a non-technical blog called [A Statistician's Journey](https://gr8lawrence.com/). Tune in if you would like to see more personal reflections and life updates from me.
