<!-- I am currently a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in [Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health and about to be a Triple Tar Heel. My research lies in the fields of [cell type deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_deconvolution) and [precision medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine). I also work with a diverse set of collaborators, using my statistical modeling and machine learning knowledge to solve practical problems in public health and allied health sciences. You can find my publications and projects on this website.

In my spare time, I like to read, travel, eat well, and play sports and trivia games. I recently developed a passion in Hold'em pokers. I also enjoy spending time with my friends and my cat [Wrigley](members/wrigley.html). -->


Hey there! I recently obtained my Ph.D. in [Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in August 2024. My research focuses on [cell type deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_deconvolution) and [precision medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine), answering how statistical modeling and machine learning can advance these fields. I collaborate with a diverse group of experts to tackle real-world problems in public health and allied health sciences. Feel free to check out my publications and projects on this website.

When I'm not immersed in research, I love to unwind with a good book, travel to new places, savor delicious meals, and get active with sports and trivia games. Lately, I've developed a keen interest in Hold'em poker. Of course, nothing beats quality time with my friends and my cat [Wrigley](members/wrigley.html).
