  description: Deconvolution of bulk tissue gene expression using only the gene signatures of a subset of cell types. This is particularly valuable when some cell types are not easily preserved for single-cell sequencing, resulting in unavailable gene signatures. Require additional parameters such as means and ranges of cell-type proportions.
