I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, advised by [Quefeng Li](http://www.bios.unc.edu/~quefeng/) and [Fei Zou](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/fei-zou-phd/). My dissertation research mainly focuses on cell type deconvolution, investigating theories and algorithms of matrix factorization. I also join research efforts in precision medicine with my colleagues from the Precision Health and AI Research Lab under [Michael Kosorok](https://tarheels.live/kosoroklab/), studying the optimal timings of individual treatments under disease progression and resource constraints.

I grew up in Beijing, China and began my college in the United States at UNC, where I obtained both a B.S.P.H (and much later, an M.S.) in Biostatistics, as well as a B.A. in Mathematics. I considered studying History and Pure Mathematics, but ultimately chose to pursue Biostatistics, as it is a quantitative subject that can bear impacts on the health of living humans.

While I am particularly enthusiastic about statistical research and consulting, topics of which you can find in the Research tab, I am also deeply interested in traveling, sampling good foods, working and reading at coffee shops, and trivia. I have recently started playing poker and aspire to become a decent player. I try my best to go to gym four times a week, and just started my training for the [2024 Tobacco Road Marathon](https://tobaccoroadmarathon.com/). My favorite sport is soccer and my favorite soccer team is [Bayern Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich). I see myself as a follower of [Epicurean philosophies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/) (for the most part).
