<!--
I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, advised by [Quefeng Li](http://www.bios.unc.edu/~quefeng/) and [Fei Zou](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/fei-zou-phd/). My dissertation research mainly focuses on cell type deconvolution, investigating theories and algorithms of matrix factorization. I also join research efforts in precision medicine with my colleagues from the Precision Health and AI Research Lab under [Michael Kosorok](https://tarheels.live/kosoroklab/), studying the optimal timings of individual treatments under disease progression and resource constraints.

I grew up in Beijing, China and began my college in the United States at UNC, where I obtained both a B.S.P.H (and much later, an M.S.) in Biostatistics, as well as a B.A. in Mathematics. I considered studying History and Pure Mathematics, but ultimately chose to pursue Biostatistics, as it is a quantitative subject that can bear impacts on the health of living humans.

While I am particularly enthusiastic about statistical research and consulting, topics of which you can find in the Research tab, I am also deeply interested in traveling, sampling good foods, working and reading at coffee shops, and trivia. I have recently started playing poker and aspire to become a decent player. I try my best to go to gym four times a week, and just started my training for the [2024 Tobacco Road Marathon](https://tobaccoroadmarathon.com/). My favorite sport is soccer and my favorite soccer team is [Bayern Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich). I see myself as a follower of [Epicurean philosophies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/) (for the most part). -->

I am finishing up my study as a Ph.D. candidate [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health in August 2024, under the guidance of [Quefeng Li](http://www.bios.unc.edu/~quefeng/) and [Fei Zou](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/fei-zou-phd/). I have successfully defended my dissertation, which primarily focuses on cell type deconvolution and investigates theories and algorithms of matrix factorization. Additionally, I research precision medicine with peers from the Precision Health and AI Research Lab, led by [Michael Kosorok](https://tarheels.live/kosoroklab/), on the optimal timing of individual treatments under disease progression and resource constraints.

I grew up on the beautiful campus of Tsinghua University in Beijing, China and attended UNC-Chapel Hill in the U.S.. Initially intending to study History and Pure Math, I ended up earning a B.S.P.H and an M.S. in Biostatistics, as well as a B.A. in Mathematics. I ultimately chose Biostatistics as my primary subject as it sits on the confluence of both quantitative thinking and practical utilities to make an impact on public health.

While my passion lies in statistical research and consulting, I also have a keen interest in traveling, savoring diverse cuisines, working and reading in coffee shops, and indulging in local trivia competitions. Recently, I've taken up poker and aspire to become proficient at it. I make an effort to hit the gym and finished the [Tobacco Road Marathon](https://tobaccoroadmarathon.com/) in March 2024 (after downing >15 cups of water and Gatorade en route to the finish line). Soccer holds a special place in my heart, with [Bayern Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich) being my favorite team. I find myself drawn to [Epicurean philosophies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/) (for the most part).
