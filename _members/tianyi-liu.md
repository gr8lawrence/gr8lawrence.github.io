My name is Tianyi Liu. I am currently a fifth year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at The University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, advised by [Quefeng Li](http://www.bios.unc.edu/~quefeng/) and [Fei Zou](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/fei-zou-phd/), and on my way to become a *Triple Tar Heel*.

I grew up in Beijing, China and began my study in the United States at UNC, where I obtained both an M.S. and a B.S.P.H in Biostatistics, as well as a B.A. in Mathematics. I considered studying History and Pure Mathematics, but ultimately chose to pursue Biostatistics as a quantitative subject that can bear impacts on the health of living humans. I see myself as a follower of [Epicurean philosophies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/) (for the most part).

While I am particularly enthusiastic about statistical research and consulting, topics of which you can find below, I am also deeply interested in traveling, sampling good foods, working and reading at coffee shops, and trivia. I have recently started playing poker and aspire to become a decent player. My favorite sport is soccer and my favorite soccer team is [Bayern Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich).
