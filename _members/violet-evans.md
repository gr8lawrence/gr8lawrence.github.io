I am an aspiring data scientist looking to align my skillset with industries that leverage *big dat*a and *predictive analytics* to tackle pressing challenges. I am eager to expand and apply my statistical knowledge to real-world challenges.

**Current Title**: M.S. Analytics at the Insitute for Advanced Analytics (IAA), North Carolina State University

**Fun Fact**: I skipped third grade!
