## Introduction

My dissertation research mainly focuses on cell type deconvolution, investigating theories and algorithms of matrix factorization. I also join research efforts in precision medicine with my colleagues, studying the optimal timings of individual treatments under disease progression and resource constraints.

On the collaborative side, I work with a group of scientists on quantifying genetic impacts of inorganic arsenics on type-II diabetes using mouse models and consult on studying efficacies of neonatal physical therapeutic interventions as well as the impacts social determinants of health on getting physical therapy services for patients.
