# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

My independent research spans questions regarding cell-type deconvolution, relying heavily on theories and algorithms of matrix factorization. I also dab in collaboration in precision medicine, work with a group of scientists on quantifying genetic impacts of inorganic arsenics on type-II diabetes using mouse models, and consult on statistical analysis for neonatal physical therapeutic interventions.
